# fourthProject

## Overview
This is my quiz generator for the fourth assignment. It is incomplete, but I was able to complete the below objectives:

## Completed:
* Responsive design
* 2 JS files - one with an array the other with base JS
* looping through the array objects
* collecting the user's score based on validated input
* Timer countdown with a time penalty

## Will Resubmit:
* after for loop is completed, set 'questionsWrapper' div class to display none and the 'finalScreen' div to display block
* print final score by returning score 
* record user input field with their initials and score
* store in local storage
